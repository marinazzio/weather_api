Location is constant to lessen the amount of requests using test account

Location ID (key): 287676 which is equivalent for Cheboksary city

There's no city filtering in API though it's not a problem to add it in the future if needed.

Due to limitations of the API usage it worth setting up the scheduled data fetching based on requests quota. 

Though it was described to define AIP urls like /weather/current, I decided to use also versioning namespace and api prefix for further convenience.
